## About
This repo contains Arduino sketches, helper libraries, and simple wiring instructions for quick hardware projects (LED effects, sensors, actuators, and small controllers). Each sketch is intended to be plug-and-play with minimal changes.

Use this repo to:
- Learn Arduino basics with working examples.
- Prototype small circuits fast.
- Reuse tested code for classroom demos or maker-fair projects.

---

## Features
- Ready-to-upload example sketches.
- Clear wiring notes for each project.
- Minimal dependencies — works with Arduino IDE (1.8+) and Arduino CLI.
- Modular code style so parts can be reused across sketches.

---

## Hardware & Parts (common)
> Replace this list per-sketch as needed.

- Arduino UNO / Nano / Pro Micro (specify which board in each sketch folder)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- LEDs (5mm), resistors (220Ω)
- RGB LED or WS2812 (NeoPixel)
- Push buttons
- Potentiometer (10k)
- DHT11 / DHT22 (temperature / humidity) — if used
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 — if used
- Relay modules / MOSFETs for driving higher loads

---

## Wiring / Schematics
Each sketch folder should include a `WIRING.md` or `schematic.png`. Example wiring for an LED:

- LED long leg → digital pin 8 (via 220Ω resistor)  
- LED short leg → GND

For NeoPixels (WS2812):
- 5V → +5V (or VIN if using same power)
- GND → GND
- DIN → digital pin 6 (use level-shifter if powering from 5V + 3.3V MCU)

> Tip: Always share a clear photo or Fritzing diagram per project — it helps others reproduce quickly.

## Installation & Setup

### Required software
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) **or** [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/)
- If a sketch uses external libs, install them via `Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries...` or Arduino CLI:
```bash
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit NeoPixel"
arduino-cli lib install "DHT sensor library"
